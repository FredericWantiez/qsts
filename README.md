# qsts

In the beginning there was [prsr](https://github.com/llyr-who/prsr). prsr performed both arithmetic parsing and back prop. 

`qsts` specialises in parsing only. There will be another repo called `drift` which performs differentiation.

`qsts` currently only works with single char variables names (e.g A and NOT Ant). There is an issue to deal with this.
