# qsts

In the beginning there was [prsr](https://github.com/llyr-who/prsr). prsr performed both arithmetic parsing and back prop. 

`qsts` specialises in parsing arithmetic expressioins and calculating derivatives via automatic differentiation. There will be another repo called `drift` which solves optimisation problems.
